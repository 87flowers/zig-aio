# CORO API

## Paired context switches

To yield running task to the caller use the following.
The function takes a enum value as a argument representing the yield state of the task.

```zig
coro.yield(SomeEnum.value);
```

To continue running the task from where it left, you need to issue the same enum value to the following function.
If the task currently isn't being yielded in the supplied state, the call is no-op.

```zig
coro.wakeupFromState(task, SomeEnum.value);
```

This is the preferred way to handle the control flow between tasks.

## Canceling IO

While it's possible to cancel IO by using the `aio.Cancel` operations. It is also possible to cancel
all IO operations currently blocking a task by doing the following.
If the task currently isn't being yielded by IO then the call is no-op.

```zig
coro.wakeupFromIo(task);
```

## Unpaired wakeup

Sometimes it's useful to be able to wakeup the task from any yielding state.

```zig
coro.wakeup(task);
```

In this case the task will wake up no matter what its yielding state is currently.
