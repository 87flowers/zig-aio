# CORO API

## Paired context switches

To yield running task to the caller use the following.
The function takes a enum value as a argument representing the yield state of the task.
Enum value that corresponds to the integer `0` is resevered to indicate non yield state.

```zig
coro.yield(SomeEnum.value);
```

The current yield state of a task can be checked with `state` method.
To wakeup a task use the `wakeup` method. When task is woken up the yield state is reset to `0`.
Calling `wakeup` when the task isn't yielded by application's yield state is a error.

Example of checking the current yield state and then waking up the task.

```zig
switch (task.state(SomeEnum)) {
    value => task.wakeup(),
}
```
